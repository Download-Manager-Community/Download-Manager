## Reporting a Vulnerability

To report a security vulnerability open a [Security vulnerability]() issue and I will attempt to respond as soon as possible.

If the vulnerability is accepted then I will update the issue as much as possible until the vulnerability has been patched.

However, if the vulnerability has been declined then i will close the issue and give a comment on why the vulnerability report was declined.
