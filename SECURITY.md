## Reporting a Vulnerability

To report a security vulnerability open a [security vulnerability]() issue and I will attempt to respond as soon as possible.

If the vulnerability is accepted then I will update the issue until the vulnerability has been patched.
Once a security vulnerability is accepted then I will attempt to get a patch released as fast as I can.

However, if the vulnerability is declined then i will close the issue and give a comment on why the vulnerability report was declined.
